# Line-Follower-Bot
In this project, weâ€™ll build a simple and efficient 3-sensor line follower robot using an Arduino, L298N motor driver, and IR sensors. Perfect for beginners and ideal for robotics competitions, this bot can follow a white path on a black surface and navigate turns using only three IR sensors.
